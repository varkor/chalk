/// An inference variable represents an unknown term -- either a type
/// or a lifetime. The variable itself is just an index into the unification
/// table; the unification table maps it to an `InferenceValue`.
///
/// Inference variables can be in one of two states (represents by the variants
/// of an `InferenceValue`):
///
/// - Unbound(`ui`). In this case, the value of the variable is not yet known. We carry
///   along a universe index `ui` that tracks the universe in which the variable was
///   created; this determines what names may appear in the variable's value.
///   - In this state, we do **not** track the kind of this variable
///     (i.e., whether it represents a type or a lifetime). There is
///     no need: if it represents a lifetime, for example, then there
///     should only ever be constraints that relate it to other
///     lifetimes, or use it in lifetime position.
/// - Bound. In this case, the value of the variable is known. We
///   carry along the value. We discard the universe index in which
///   the variable was created, since that was only needed to help us
///   reject illegal values. Once the value of a variable is known, it
///   can never change.
///   - The value we actually store for variables is a
///     `ir::Parameter`, and hence it does carry along the kind of the
///     variable via the enum variant. However, we should always know
///     the kind of the variable from context, and hence we typically
///     "downcast" the resulting variable using
///     e.g. `value.ty().unwrap()`.
